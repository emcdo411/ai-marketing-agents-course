üì¶ Day 3 Demo Data (Trainer-Ready)

What this does

Creates (or overwrites) the SQLite DB in data/leads_scored_segmentation.db

Builds two source tables: leads_scored, transactions

Calls your Day 2 script to generate customer_features

Prints quick previews so you know it worked

Trainer-ready demo seeder for Week 1 ‚Äî Day 3

Creates a small SQLite dataset:
- leads_scored         (5 rows)
- transactions         (8 rows)
Then imports the Day 2 feature builder to produce:
- customer_features    (5 rows)

2) How to run (non-technical)

Open your terminal and go to your repo root:

cd ai-marketing-agents-course


Make sure you‚Äôve installed the basics (only once):

pip install pandas sqlalchemy python-dotenv


Make sure your .env exists (or rely on default SQLite):

# .env at repo root (optional for SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/leads_scored_segmentation.db


Run the seeder:

python course/week1/day3/seed_demo_data.py


You should see:

tables leads_scored and transactions created & filled

customer_features built and previewed

Now run your Day 3 graph:

cd course/week1/day3
python run_graph.py --segment 2 --limit 50

3) Trainer tips (live session)

Timebox the seeding step (it runs in ~1‚Äì2 seconds).

After the preview prints, ask:

‚ÄúWhich of these fields (frequency, recency, rating) would you show an executive first, and why?‚Äù

Then run the graph and compare different --segment values so learners see varied summaries.
